# Changelog
# [2026.3.4] - 2026-03-23

### Added

- Battery cycle support:
- Native cycle counter sensor via register `34003` for `a`, `d`, and `e_v3`.
- Calculated cycle sensor (`battery_cycle_count_calc`) for all device profiles (`a`, `d`, `e_v3`, `e_v12`) based on `total_discharging_energy / battery_total_energy`.

### Changed

- Sensor setup in `sensor.py` refactored to a compact grouped entity creation loop.
- Cycle sensor translation labels aligned across locales and naming simplified (`Cycle Count` / `Cycle Count (Calc)`).

# [2026.3.3] - 2026-03-04

### Added

- Per-field schedule support: split packed schedule blocks into individual registers and expose `schedule_1..6` as separate entities (`*_days`, `*_start`, `*_end`, `*_mode`, `*_enabled`) in the register maps for `a.yaml`, `d.yaml`, `e_v3.yaml` and `e_v12.yaml`.

### Changed

- Schedule entities set to `category: config` and `scan_interval: very_low` (default 300s); README updated with schedule rows and notes about HHMM time input and day-selection limitations.
- Device-specific `schedule_*_mode` limits applied (A / E-v3: -2500..2500 W, D: -2200..2200 W).
- Load YAML register definitions off the Home Assistant event loop to avoid blocking (async-safe coordinator changes).

### Fixed

- Decoding and signed `int16` handling for schedule mode values and writes improved.

# [2026.3.2] - 2026-03-03

### Added

- Schedule support: read/write packed schedule blocks (6 schedules × 5 registers) exposed as aggregated sensors with enriched attributes and enable switches.
- Expose raw schedule registers in entity attributes for easier debugging.
- Translations for schedule sensors added (en/nl/de).

### Changed

- Avoid blocking YAML I/O on the Home Assistant event loop when loading register definitions.
- Sensor state for schedules now represents the enabled flag; full decoded schedule is available in attributes (days_list, start_time, end_time, mode, power, enabled_bool, raw).
- Modbus client returns raw register lists for schedule blocks; coordinator persists raw + decoded attrs; sensor performs decoding and formatting.

### Fixed

- Handle signed int16 mode values correctly when writing schedules (two's-complement conversion).
- Fixed import/indentation issues and improved debug logging for Modbus reads/writes.

# [2025.11.1] - 2025-11-17

### Added 

- Config flow: Unit ID is now a plain input field, with validation and error handling.

## [2025.10.1] - 2025-10-15

### Added 

- Config flow now asks for device version (v1/v2 or v3) during setup so the integration can load the correct register map at runtime.
- Per-version register modules: `registers_v12.py` (v1/v2) and `registers_v3.py` (v3). The integration selects the right definitions based on the chosen version.

### Fixed

- Options flow: removed deprecated explicit `config_entry` assignment (compatibility with HA 2025.12).
- Modbus client: properly handle CancelledError during shutdown; guard reconnection and client recreation to avoid NoneType errors and noisy ERROR logs on stop/reload.
- Efficiency sensors: skip calculations when denominators are zero or required inputs are missing to avoid division-by-zero errors.
- Energy sensors: ensure `state_class` is set to `total` or `total_increasing` for sensors with `device_class: energy`.

### Notes

- `registers_v3.py` is generated from CSV mapping; entries are untested and require manual verification on v3 hardware before production use.

## [2025.9.4] - 2025-09-22

### Added

### Fixed
